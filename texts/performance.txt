Performance

Silent, energy-efficient
The fanless, energy-efficient Raspberry Pi runs silently and uses far less power than other computers.

Networking
Fast networking
Raspberry Pi 4 comes with Gigabit Ethernet, along with onboard wireless networking and Bluetooth.

USB 3
Your new Raspberry Pi 4 has upgraded USB capacity: along with two USB 2 ports you'll 
find two USB 3 ports, which can transfer data up to ten times faster.

Choice of RAM
Your choice of RAM
We're making different variants of the Raspberry Pi 4 available, 
depending on how much RAM you need â€” 2GB, 4GB, or 8GB.


Software

LibreOffice app
simplest way to add application packages 
wider range of software is the Add / Remove Software utility

You can see from the category list what sorts of things are included in this utility; 
in addition to the obvious LibreOffice and Claws Mail, there is the VNC Viewer remote desktop client. 
A lot of the other things in here are educational or hobbyist oriented

you plan to use your Raspberry Pi 4 as a desktop system running a significant number of applications, 
you should definitely get at least the 2GB model. The price difference is small, 
and the performance benefit is large.



Hardware (You will need)
A 15W USB-C power supply 
A microSD card loaded with NOOBS, the software that installs the operating system 
(buy a pre-loaded SD card along with your Raspberry Pi)
A keyboard and mouse
