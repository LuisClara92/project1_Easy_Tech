    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        Think Big, Start Small

We began by solving our own pain points. It’s always best to become an expert in an area, find a pain point and go after it because we have a better idea of where to go.

The first step to our journey was a little different. 
To start Easy Tech, it required a lot of research to produce our first version of the easy tech. We spend a lot of hours and try outs with hardware and software. 
We placed 10,000€ on the back of our personals cards to start. This was money we didn’t have and also money we definitely didn’t want to waste. 

In business, you need to be courageous. Don’t be that person who was too afraid to jump off the entrepreneurial cliff. 
If you are not scared, then your goals are not big enough. Reach for the sky and whenever you reach your goal, set another one bigger and bolder.

The best piece of advice to all young entrepreneurs out there, not just us, would be: Start earlier. It’s never too early.

We can give is to just get started. If we realized how much we would need to know before we started, we probably would have been too terrified to get going. 
But We are a big believers of just-in-time learning, and we’ve learned a lot as Easy Tech grew, and we’ll continue to keep learning as we grow.
